            Blogs are meant to provide learning resources for learning the
            technology that you wish to work with. These blogs are categorised
            in multiple tags which empowers direct navigation to required
            content. Blogs are free for anyone to read but only administrators
            can publish them.

            Kalam is the interactive multi-facet learning platform especially
            for web development. We are a team of 4 computer science engineering
            students (Ashish, Asmit, Gargeya, Gaurav) from University of
            Petroleum and Energy Studies pursuing the course specialised in
            Cyber Security and Forensics. We thought of Kalam as our small
            contribution to society which is urging to seek digital education
            from and throughout the world. Due to recent pandemic, we all were
            forced to change our lifestyle and make even the most mundane tasks
            virtual and digital. Due to such a pressure, it was a time of crisis
            of numerous sectors but especially education sector. Kalam provides
            a way to do all the basic tasks required to learn web development at
            one place. You can learn the concepts through blogs and then can
            perform hands on practise on the practise feature.
